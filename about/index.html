    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Welcome to dokkodo.xyz—a personal memoir exploring the intersections of money, meditations, music, and mountains.</p>

    <h2>The Name</h2>
    <p><em>Dokkōdō</em> (独行道), "The Path of Aloneness" or "The Way of Walking Alone," was written by Miyamoto Musashi shortly before his death in 1645. It consists of 21 precepts on self-discipline and independence—a guide for living deliberately.</p>

    <h2>The Four Pillars</h2>
    <p><strong>Money</strong> — Explorations in finance, markets, and the art of capital allocation.</p>
    <p><strong>Meditations</strong> — Thoughts, learnings, and reflections on the journey.</p>
    <p><strong>Music</strong> — The artists, albums, and sounds that move me.</p>
    <p><strong>Mountains</strong> — Adventures in the wilderness and the lessons they teach.</p>
