## Musashi's 21 Precepts

The Dokkōdō was written by Miyamoto Musashi a week before his death. These precepts offer guidance on living with discipline and independence.

1. Accept everything just the way it is.
2. Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.
3. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
4. Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.
